# Will-and-Want

Characters
==========
Onumada (Want)
------------
What is the difference between Animal and Man?
Onu is the the First Man. He is largely a comical character, given to slapstick actions. Intellectually he is a hyper genius, probably if he got his act together, he could single handly take his race from prehistory to interstellar travel in two generations. Behavoirly he is extremely primitive, an animal driven completely by instinctual wants.  

He lives among a tribe of other men and women. However he is clearly intellectually vastly superior to his tribe. From a social standpoint he is at the bottom of the pecking order. He should be drawn to emphasize the physical differences between him and the rest of the tribe. Huge amounts of his mental and physical efforts relate to sexual gratification. The vast majority of the children of the tribe should physically resemble Onu instead of their father. 

He should be drawn comically with extremely exaggerated/stereotypical facial expressions. 

Chief aspects he brings to story is comedy, empathy, and humanity. His milestone is the development of a being who can put intellectual/moral/personal/longterm gratification ahead of his animal wants. 

Drivers: Wants
- First Man Driven By Want:Hunger
- First Man Driven By Want:Lust
- First Man Driven By Want:Fear
- First Man Driven By Love/Affection for his offspring*

Eye (Will)
--------
What is difference between Algorithm/Program and Man?
Eye is an observer without any agency of his own. He is largely the straight man, and the voice of logic. His purpose is to be an observer of the primitive beings of this story. Why these beings are being observed is not clear. There are many Eye like units that appear throughout the story, that take on different physical forms. Eventually the other Eye units will become antagonists. 

Eye's behavoir is completely constrained by his directives. The story of Eye is how modifications both physically and more importantly in his programming eventually leads to the rise of self awareness and free will. His observations of Onu are the seeds which begins and guides this process*. The 4th directive is the key flexibility in his programming that allows for modification of his inherent programming. 

Physically Eye can take various forms, as the ability for self repair is over time corrupted into ability for self modification. His initial form should be something like a large cylindrical upright tube with a single black rectangular eye. His final form should be something like a humanoid form with a single black retangular eye, and a host of other measurment instruments that are arrayed to resemble opened angel wings. 

Chief aspects he brings to story is logic and exposition/explanation to the audience. His milestone is the development of a being that has free will, as he can eventually rewrite his directives to remove constriants on his behavoir.

Constraints: Directives
1. Eye Shall Observe
2. Eye Must Not Contaminate Observation
3. Eye Must Not Experiment
4. Eye May Prioritize Resources to Optimize Observations*

Story
=====

### Scene 1:
*Flexible but must establish impossibility to attaining Fruit and intense desire for said Fruit.

Eye's Caption: 1. Eye Shall Observe

Panel winks on, in manner that somewhat evokes eye opening and/or computer booting up. 

Panel is is initially unfocused/unclear, as panel focuses an organic object takes center stage. This is the Fruit. Important longterm as this is Onu's most consistent go to 'Want'. The object of his desire and cheif bribery tool. 

Zooming outwards reveals the Fruit is perched on top of immensely tall tree. Tree should be extremely alien and visually should appear difficult to climb. Weirder the better.

A tiny figure stands at the bottom of the tree stairing up slack jawed and comically hungry primitive figure.

Zooming in on face of figure shows for the first time the face of want, uncontrolled, animal desire. Comical. This specific expression is very important as time and again Onu's face of want expression will be used to convey his motivation.

### Scene 2:
*Contrived but must establish Eye's ability for self repair. If the hijinks of Onu's failures are not strong enough from purely 'entertainment' standpoint whole scene can be droped.

Onu walks around the tree looking for any possible footholds and or means of climbing the tree. There are numerous oddly shaped healed over scars on the tree.

Onu attempts to climb up the tree. He comically fails in slapstick fashion. 

Onu attempts a running head start to climb up the tree. Even greater slapstick failure.

Onu appears convinced that climbing the tree is impossible, that there are not sufficient footholds for climbing the tree to use as footholds.

Onu next attempts to throw rocks upwards and knock down the Fruit. At it's peak the rock falls far short of the fruit. 

Eye watches the parabola of the rock arc, as rock plumments we see it getting larger and larger in Eye's viewscreen. 

Eventually it impacts and damages Eye's view screen. *Cracks should appear across following  panels showing Eye's viewpoint until Eye has initiated self repair.
 
Onu sits down exasparatedly and carefully begins weaving grasses together eventually creating a long rope. He Ties the rock to end of rope. Onu builds up momentum by swinging weighted rope in a circular fashion and again launches it at the Fruit. Another failure.

Eye again watches the rock arc as it plumments and we see it getting larger and larger. 
Caption: Eye Must Not Contaminate Observation

Eye does not intervene and again the rock's impact damages Eye's view screen.

Onu walks off turning his back on the Fruit tree. 

Onu's path begins to lead him upwards and upwards becoming more onorous and difficult as it does.

Eventually Onu reaches a cliff, walking over to the edge of the cliff he fearfully approaches the ledge.

Onu's view from the ledge shows he is now above and relatively close to the Fruit bearing part of the Fruit tree.

After some reflection and struggle with his own fear Onu takes a running leap off the edge. 

Portrayal of Onu's midflight leap should empasize his passion/fear etc.

Onu lands successful on the Fruit tree's crown. After some recovery and celebration of his success he makes his way to the Fruit.
